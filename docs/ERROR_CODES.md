# Parse Error Code Map

Standardized error codes used by the analyzer. Errors are stored as strings in the
form `[CODE] message` for backwards compatibility.

## Severity Levels

- `error`: analysis failed or output is unreliable
- `warning`: analysis continued with degraded accuracy
- `info`: informational, no impact on results
